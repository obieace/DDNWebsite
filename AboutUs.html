    Founded in 2012, Domain Dream Network provides consulting and end-to-end support on digital products and services. We believe that blockchain technology is the future and we are committed to providing solutions built on the newest innovations to bring about financial freedom for our clients.
    Domain Dream Network started out in Lagos, Nigeria providing content for radio and also other mainstream media. However, due to the recession in the country in 2015, we had to suspend productions and focus on training.
    In 2021, with the CEO now residing in Ontario, Canada, the company ventured into blockchain technology and providing digital services.
